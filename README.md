Price Comparison Website

Shopaza, our online project for price comparison, gathers information on product prices from many websites and makes it accessible to clients. 
After that, users can select the best solution to buy. This pricing comparison tool can even be used by online retailers to analyze their 
competitors and create innovative marketing strategies that will help them stand out from the competition and attract more customers. 
The project was made using PHP and SQL.
